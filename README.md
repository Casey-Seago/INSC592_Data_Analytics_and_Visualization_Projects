## Exploratory_Analysis:
We were given a dataset of anonymized student data and had to investigate changes in student grades in the course MATH119 over time.

## Dairy_Analysis:
Students were assigned to teach 30 minute lesssons to the class on different analysis methods/softwares. I taught the lesson on R. I structured my lesson by showing the class a variety of ways that R can be used to answer questions about a dataset.
